        <h1>Basketball!</h1>
        <p>Basketball has always been more than just a sport to me—it's a passion. I fell in love with the game when I was a kid, spending hours at the court near my home shooting hoops, rain or shine.</p>
        <p>At first, it was just a fun way to move and burn energy. But gradually, I began to appreciate the beauty of the game—the rhythm of dribbling, the art of passing, and the satisfaction of a perfect shot swishing through the net.</p>
        <p>As I played more, I also started watching professional games, studying how players move without the ball, how they communicate, and how team chemistry is built. I was especially inspired by legends like Kobe Bryant and Stephen Curry—their work ethic, their mindset, their love for the game.</p>
        <p>I began training regularly, improving my ball-handling, shooting form, and court awareness. I played pickup games with friends and entered local tournaments whenever I could.</p>

        <p>Here are my current basketball stats (unofficial but fun!):</p>

            <div class="blitz" style="color: lightgreen;">
                <h2>Jump</h2>

        <p>One of my proudest moments was when I helped lead my team to victory in a high school tournament. The final game went into overtime, and I hit the game-winning shot. That moment still gives me chills.</p>
        <p>For me, basketball is not just about competition—it's about connection, confidence, and continuous growth. It's where I find joy, discipline, and community.</p>
        <p>Whether I’m on the court, watching NBA games, or playing 2K with friends, basketball will always be part of who I am.</p>
